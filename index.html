John Smith is a senior business major who works part-time at the campus bookstore and is also involved in three clubs. The career center helps students with various things like resumes and interviews and networking and LinkedIn profiles. He goes there every week because he thinks it's important.`,
        '2': `I interviewed John last Tuesday after his classes were done for the day and he seemed pretty tired but still willing to talk to me. It was in the library's second floor study room B which I reserved for an hour just to make sure we had enough time and privacy and it was actually a really nice quiet space except for when a group of loud students walked by. I asked questions about his experience, specifically focusing on his academic journey and career preparation.`,
        '3': `Programming classes present numerous challenges for new students because they require a completely different way of thinking and problem-solving that most students haven't encountered before in their academic careers and this can be overwhelming especially in the beginning when everything feels new and confusing. Students fail them sometimes, particularly the first programming course which has a 30% failure rate according to John.`,
        '4': `Based on my research and interview findings the following recommendations can be made for future students who want to succeed in the computer science program at our university which has been consistently ranked in the top 50 programs nationwide according to various publications and rankings that I found online while doing background research for this project. The tutoring center is located in the library's second floor right next to the computer lab.`
